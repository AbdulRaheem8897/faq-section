                        <p>The question “Who am I?” has preoccupied both philosophers and academics alike for millennia. The ancient scriptural wisdom of India explains that the bodies we see with our eyes – white, black, Indian, European, Greek, Chinese – are temporary, external designations. The real person, the spirit soul, dwells within. It is not that we should claim “I have a soul”. In fact you are the soul. The real understanding is, “I am a soul and I have a body”. When the body dies, the soul continues to live and moves onto another destination.</p>

                        <p>If there is life, it is the symptom of the presence of a soul. When a soul is present, all living things undergo six changes: they are born, they grow, they endure for a while, they produce offspring, they dwindle and then they die. These six stages can be seen in plants, animals, insects and even microbes although the duration of each stage will differ. If these six stages are present it means there is the presence of a soul which is the cause of these changes. Once the soul leaves, the organism dies</p>

                        <p>As spirit souls, we originate from the spiritual sky – which one may consider to be heaven. We have fallen into the material world which is a temporary place, and we become conditioned by its laws (the modes of material nature). Therefore we forget who we really are. We then believe that we are these bodies and act to satisfy our senses. Since sense pleasure is temporary, we will always remain unsatisfied. We often attempt to increase our sense enjoyment more and more and in quite diverse ways. To think that we can achieve real happiness through the mind, body and senses is an illusion. One who does not know the difference between the material and spiritual realities is considered materially conditioned.</p>

                        <p>God has many names, but God is one. When we refer to God as the “Supreme” Lord, then there can only be one “Supreme” or it renders the term meaningless. The analogy of the Sun can be used to explain this idea. The Sun in Spanish is called ‘sol’, in English is called ‘sun’ and in Swahili is called ‘jua’. However none of those languages can have any claim of proprietorship over the Sun. It is not the Spanish Sun any more than it belongs to the people of Africa; it is the same sun that shines everywhere. Similarly, God is one and he has different names. Krishna is the original name of God in Sanskrit, which means ‘The All Attractive One’. Nobody in any religion denies the all attractive nature of God.</p>

                        <p>This is the mantra for liberation in this age. Mantra means spiritual sound vibration. Material sounds affect us on the material emotional, psychological and intellectual levels, and clutter our consciousness. Spiritual sound vibrations, in particular, this Maha-mantra (the greatest chant for deliverance in this age) connects with who you really are (the soul) and revives our dormant spiritual consciousness. It re-awakens the conditioned soul to his real identity. The mantra is not a sectarian chant belonging to a particular religion. It is a chant of names of God and can be chanted by anyone. It is a transcendental sound vibration that connects with the spirit soul; the soul cannot be Muslim, Hindu, Christian or Jew; the soul is simply what it is – pure spirit.</p>
